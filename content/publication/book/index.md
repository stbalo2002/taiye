abstract: The WHO global initiative on national quality policy and strategy aims to support Member States improve the performance of their health system through the development and execution of national direction on quality. The development, refinement and implementation of a national quality policy and strategy (NQPS) is an emerging priority for countries as they strive to systematically improve the performance of their health care systems. With the growing momentum towards UHC, there is a corresponding growing awareness that improved access must be accompanied by focused efforts to improve the quality of health services, if desired improvements in health outcomes are to be achieved. Working alongside Member States and technical partners, WHO has co-developed a practical approach for developing national policy and strategy to improve quality of care, as outlined in the Handbook for national quality policy and strategy.
