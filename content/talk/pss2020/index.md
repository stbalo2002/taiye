abstract: In recent years, the Global Ministerial Summit on Patient Safety has become one of the central platforms for improving patient safety worldwide. It represents an effective tool for facilitating collaboration between countries and stakeholders alike. Since their inception in 2016, the Summits have succeeded in raising awareness, as well as creating and maintaining the momentum of the global patient safety movement, as evidenced by the recent adoption of the World Health Assembly resolution on the “Global Action on Patient Safety”. One of the key challenges that we are currently facing consists of ensuring the appropriate and sustainable implementation of suitable concepts and approaches, crucial to ensure the success of the WHA-resolution. Building on the success of past Summits, the 2020 Summit in Switzerland will focus on the critical issue of implementation, with the slogan - *“Less harm better care - from resolution to implementation”*

  
  The Summit will acknowledge the progress made thus far and, at the same time, contemplate the future of this global public health endeavor. The aim of the Summit is to bring together experts, stakeholders and ministers from around the world to share knowledge and experience.
