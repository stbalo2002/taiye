I am a Public Health Expert, Project Manager, [Data Scientist](https://www.r4hds.github.io/) and Quality Improvement Expert with about 10 years of experience working with International non-governmental organizations, and in the private and public healthcare sectors providing institutional support to primary and secondary hospitals, leading quality improvement projects, and engaging government stakeholders on health-related activities. I have been involved in the management The Global Fund, AIDS Healthcare Foundation, PEPFAR and Vitamin Angels grants. I believe in a blend of predictive and agile principles and methodologies to maximise projects benefits and achieve deliverables. 

My passion for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety has led me to be actively involved with both the [International Society for Quality Healthcare (ISQua)](https://www.isqua.org/) and the [Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI)](https://ihi.org/) over the last 7 years. I have won several awards in healthcare quality and safety including the Delegates Choice Best Poster Award at the 36th ISQua Conference in Cape Town, South Africa in 2019. Currently, I am leading a team of QI champions in Nigeria to establish a community of Quality Improvement and Patient Safety.
